## Installation
For the application to sucessful work you must have node.js installed on your computer. 
This can be done by following the link here [download node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
Once node is installed, the next step is to installed inquierer. This is done by opening the terminal and in the command line typing in 'npm init -y' and letting it download. Then in the command line again typing 'npm install inquirer'. 
This will allow the inqurier function to successfully work, i.e. allowing you to answer the questions. 

## Usage
The user opens the command terminal by right clicking and selecting 'Open Integrated Terminal'

The user will then be presented with a question, which they answer, then another question. The process continues until all questions have been answered. 
Once all questions are answered, the user is presented with a message.
